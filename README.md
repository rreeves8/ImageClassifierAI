# ImageClassifierAI
A Neural Network that can determine the hand drawn number on a grey scale image. Training data is from the MNIST database of hand drawn images. Coded from scratch

Issues: 
  Propogation methods are completeded however error in the assembly of Connection and Neuron objects is causing issues 
  Error in back propogation fomrula for the internal layers I think is casuing more issues

Future Updates: 
  Database to store weights and biases for continued training 
  GUI for displaying the image and the AI's guess at what number it is


This code is no where near optimized or at best coding practices yet
