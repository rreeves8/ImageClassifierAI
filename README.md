# ImageClassifierAI
A Neural Network that can determine the hand-drawn number on a greyscale image. Training data is from the MNIST database of hand-drawn images. Coded from scratch

Issues: 
  Propagation methods are completed however error in the assembly of Connection and Neuron objects is causing issues 
  Error in back propagation formula for the internal layers I think is causing more issues

Future Updates: 
  Database to store weights and biases for continued training 
  GUI for displaying the image and the AI's guess at what number it is
